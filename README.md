# RAG_crude
**RAG Project based on Crude Knowledge Base Search**\

In this Project we have a Knowledge base containing Document about a Fictional Insurance Tech Company named Insurellm. It includes info about its employees, products, contracts with Clients, as well as about the Company itself.  
Uses Openai to create a chatbot which implements a crude string-search based RAG, using the Knowledgebase.  
The app.py starts a Chatbot using Gradio which is context aware about Insurellm, and doesn't hallucinate for irrelevant context.
